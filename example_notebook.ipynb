    "Recall for this assignment that gravity pulls down (in the $\\hat{k}$, or $z$-direction) with a uniform acceleration $\\vec{a} = g\\,(-\\hat{k})$, where $g = |\\vec{g}| = (9.8\\,\\text{m/s}^2)$. For each small interval of time $dt$, this acceleration will deliver an impulse to a particle $$d\\vec{p} = m\\,\\vec{g}\\,dt,$$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle. If we denote the coordinate vector of the particle $\\vec{r} = x\\,\\hat{\\imath} + y\\,\\hat{\\jmath} + z\\,\\hat{k}$ by the tuple of its components $(x,\\,y,\\,z)$, then we can denote the impulse per unit time $dt$ by the tuple $$d\\vec{p} \\sim (0,\\,0,\\,-m\\,g\\,dt).$$ Use this impulse when telling particles how to accelerate when moving within a gravitational field."
